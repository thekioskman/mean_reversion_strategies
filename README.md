Mean Reversion
==================
Here I test out some of the mean reversion strategies found in algorithmic trading textbooks to see how well they work in practice now (how well I can actually execute them... lol). The Strategies here were read about in Algorithmic Trading by Ernest P. Chan - a great book but hard to follow at times. The initial roughwork and visualization of the strategy will be in jupyter notebook, then we will do a proper backtest in Backtrader (Python backtesting library)
